## Demo

- Select the PMV (within the same security context) that matches the desired process and KPI type, then click the **"Show Statistic"** button. This will display a raw data visualized process diagram alongside an analyzed statistics table. *(In this version, the data is limited to **"DONE"** cases with fewer than **TWO** alternative elements in their process.)*

- To gain deeper insights, additional filter criteria have been included: time intervals and custom field values.
  1) Time interval filter: By default, this filter includes all cases whose start timestamp falls within the specified time range.
  2) Custom filter: This option allows users to filter cases based on custom field values (from the case or task) that match the specified conditions.
