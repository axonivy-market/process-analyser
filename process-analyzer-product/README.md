## Demo

- Select the PMV  that matches the desired process and KPI type, then click the **"Show Statistic"** button. This will display a raw data visualized process diagram alongside an analyzed statistics table. *(In this version, the data is limited to **"DONE"** cases with fewer than **TWO** alternative elements in their process.)*

- To gain deeper insights, additional filter criteria have been included: 
  1) **Time interval filter:** By default, this filter includes all **"DONE"** cases with a start timestamp that falls within the specified time range.
  2) **Custom filter:** This option allows users to filter cases based on custom field values (from the case or task) that match the specified conditions.
